## Game Notes
You are a Space Ship, in a Space Shooter: press **Space** to shoot ;)
Shoot anything that **isn't you**. And don't hit 'em or their bullets.

---

*"Guns. Lots of 'em."*

You can use different types of bullets to fire. A short description of what's available:

### Gun 1

---

## Collectibles
Collectibles are of two types: **Ammo** and **Others**.

### Ammo
Ammo is for guns. They add on for Guns other than that for Fire Fury, in which case the bullet power is boosted.

### Others
Others give health, lives, and points.

All collectibles disappear after some time.

---

## Points
Points can be accumulated by killing enemies or picking up collectibles. Once you cross a number of points, a life gets added. Once a new life gets added, your points drop down to zero. This is done till you have the maximum number of lives, after which you can accumulate as many points as you like, as long as you don't lose your life.

---

## Enemies
Enemies aren't spawned as such. Only certain types of enemies are allowed in a given level. One may usually expect the difficulty level to increase with level.

Do not stand in their way if they can shoot. Use appropriate guns instead.

---

## User Experience

## Game Debugging
Look at the **Game Log** if the game does not run properly. In case you aren't able to see anything in it, report it to [us](#contact-us).

---

## Themes
Themes are to be written in a file having `.INI` extension. A batch file/shell script is to be provided, passing the `.INI` filename as a command line argument to the executable. The game files are to be placed in the same directory as the executable. A sample theme, **GREEN**, has been given. If you are interested in making themes, contact [us](#contact-us) for the **specs**.

---

## Source Code
The source code (in **C**) for this game has been given. We believe in writing useful (?) free software. We hope you appreciate our efforts and respect [our feelings](#welcome) and [copyrights](#copyrights) for this game.

- You should have these external libraries to make the program: **Allegro**, **JGMOD**/**DUMB (DUMBOGG)**, and **Allegrofont**.
- The **DirextX SDK** is needed to compile the software for Windows.
- **libogg**, **libvorbis**, and **libvobisfile** are needed for **DUMBOGG** support.
- **JGMOD** support is still provided, for a Psenti. It was used first. It can still be used now, if the **DUMB** code fails for **DOS**. However, loading of **IT** and **OGG** files may not be possible in **JGMOD**, and that of **JGM** files in **DUMB**.
- Has been tested on **Windows** and **GNU/Linux** platforms.
- You should have a compliant compiler such as **GCC**.
- **MIDI** isn't used in this distro. If you are keen on it, you can see for yourself that the source is **MIDI** compatible.
- For a list of what changes/fixes/improvements have been done to the code, please read the **LOG.TXT** in the source directory.
